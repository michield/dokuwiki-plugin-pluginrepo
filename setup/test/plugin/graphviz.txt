This plugin can create directed and non-directed graph images from a textual description language called "dot" using the Graphviz program. It can use a locally installed graphviz or use Google's chart API for rendering.

The plugin supports exporting to OpenOffice through the [[odt|ODT Plugin]] (only with a local graphviz install).

For more information on Graphviz and the dot language refer to the [[http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php|Graphviz documentation]]

This plugin was originally written by [[calle@ioslo.net|Carl-Christian Salvesen]]. The current plugin is a nearly complete rewrite and differs on how it works internally and where graphs are stored.
